# Day 3 - Modules and pip in Python!
# Module is like a code library which can be used to borrow code written by somebody else in our python program. There are two types of modules in python:

# Built in Modules - These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.
# External Modules - These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.
# The pip command
# It can be used as a package manager pip to install a python module. Lets install a module called pandas using the following command

# pip install pandas
# Using a module in Python (Usage)
# We use the import syntax to import a module in Python. Here is an example code:

import pandas
# Read and work with a file named 'words.csv'
df = pandas.read_csv('words.csv')
print(df) # This will display first few rows from the words.csv file
# Similarly we can install other modules and look into their documentations for usage instructions.
# We will find ourselved doing this often in the later part of this course
