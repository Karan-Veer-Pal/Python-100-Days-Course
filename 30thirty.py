# Day : 30 Recursion

# Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.

# Formula : factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)

# Python Recursive Function
# In Python, we know that a function can call other functions. It is even possible for the function to call itself. These types of construct are termed as recursive functions.

# In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1 or sometimes from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1.
